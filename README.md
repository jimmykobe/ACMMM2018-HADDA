# Setup

* Prerequisites: Python3.6, pytorch=0.3.0, Numpy, Pillow, SciPy

* The source code files:

  1. "models": Contains the network architectures and the definitions of the loss functions.
  2. "core": Contains the pratraining, training files.
  3. "datasets": Contains datasets loading
  4. "misc": Contains initialization and some preprocessing functions
  

# Training

To run the main file with the file config_MU or config_PIE2705 in misc folder
